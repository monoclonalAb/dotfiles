# dotfiles

These are my half-baked dotfiles. They might just need to be updated and cleaned up so they are more presentable to the general public.

For personal use, just clone the repository and create symbolic links to your home directory for each folder.

In `Powershell`:
``` shell 
new-item -itemtype symboliclink -path . -name NameOfNewDirectory -value C:\Users\Path\To\New\Directory
```
